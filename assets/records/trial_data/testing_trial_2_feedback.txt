The area the pilot can most improve in is ensuring a safe landing. To achieve this, increase thrust as needed to slow down when descending towards the landing pad. I'm confident in your ability to refine your control skills and achieve the target task effectively. Keep practicing and adjusting as needed to enhance your performance.
