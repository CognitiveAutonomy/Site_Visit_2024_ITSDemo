You did a great job getting your drone into the air and navigating around obstacles. However, a key area for improvement is the smoothness of your landing approach. To enhance this, try adjusting the tilt in small increments to maintain stability as you align the drone to the landing pad. I am confident in your abilities to master these tasks with practice. It's important to remember that you received assistance during this session, so continue working on your manual landing skills for better control in future flights.
