The drone's landing trajectory was misaligned, leading to a crash. You need to adjust the tilt to correct the drone's path towards the landing pad and increase thrust to stabilize its descent. Reflect on how well you managed your control inputs and consider what adjustments can result in a successful landing next time. This attempt highlighted a failure to secure an effective landing; improvement is essential to prevent future crashes.
