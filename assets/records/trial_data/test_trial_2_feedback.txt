Great job on successfully avoiding a crash while maneuvering! One area where you can improve is your landing speed, as it seems a bit too fast upon approach. To refine this, consider increasing thrust as needed to slow down when descending towards the landing pad. I believe you have the skills to master this task effectively. Keep up the good work!
