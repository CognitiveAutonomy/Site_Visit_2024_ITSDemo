The drone's approach to landing lacked smoothness, indicating that adjustments are needed in controlling the descent. Increase thrust as needed to slow down when descending towards the landing pad. Reflect on how maintaining control over the descent can lead to a more stable landing next time. This attempt failed to achieve a controlled approach, which is essential for landing accuracy.
