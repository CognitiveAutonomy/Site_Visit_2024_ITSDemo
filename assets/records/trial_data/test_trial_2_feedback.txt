Great job on navigating the drone throughout the trajectory while avoiding any crashes! To enhance your landing, focus on tilting the drone slightly to maintain a more stable angle as you approach the landing pad. I have confidence in your ability to refine your skills and achieve safe landings consistently. Keep up the good work, and remember that each flight is an opportunity to improve!
