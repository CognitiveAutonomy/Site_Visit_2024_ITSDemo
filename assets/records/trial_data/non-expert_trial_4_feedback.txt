You're showing great effort in maneuvering the drone. However, you can improve the smoothness of your flight trajectory as it approaches the landing pad. To enhance this, try adjusting the tilt in small increments to keep the drone stable while aligning it for landing. I have confidence in your ability to master these skills and complete the task effectively. Overall, your progress is promising, and I look forward to seeing your continued improvement.
