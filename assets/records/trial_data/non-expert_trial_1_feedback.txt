The landing speed was excessive, making it difficult for the drone to maintain stability during the descent. You should reduce thrust earlier to ensure a controlled landing before reaching the designated area. Reflect on how speed management could lead to more successful landings in the future. This attempt was unsatisfactory as control over speed was lacking, resulting in a missed target. Improve your thrust management to achieve better precision on your next attempt.
