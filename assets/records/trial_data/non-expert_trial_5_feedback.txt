You did a great job initiating the flight and maneuvering the drone towards the landing pad. However, you can improve in achieving a more direct approach to the landing area, which will enhance your efficiency. To accomplish this, adjust the tilt to align the drone's flight path to the landing pad as you descend. I am confident in your ability to refine your skills and complete this task successfully. Overall, keep focusing on refining your movements for improved precision.
