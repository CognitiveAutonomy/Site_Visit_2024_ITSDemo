The drone's ending position clearly indicates that it missed the landing pad completely. You need to adjust the tilt to align the drone's flight path to the landing pad while using thrust to control your descent speed. Reflect on how the adjustments to your controls impacted your ending position and what can be done differently for better accuracy next time. This attempt was poorly executed, and failing to land on the pad reflects a lack of control that needs serious attention.
