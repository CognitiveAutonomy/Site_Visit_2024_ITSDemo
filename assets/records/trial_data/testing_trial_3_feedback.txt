You did a great job preventing any crashes during your flight. I believe you have the potential to achieve high-level performance in your landings. To enhance your landing speed, try increasing thrust as needed to slow down when descending towards the landing pad. Remember, receiving some assistance is helpful, but more practice with manual landings will build your skills further.
