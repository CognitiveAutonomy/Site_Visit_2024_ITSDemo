You did a great job avoiding a crash during your landing attempt. However, you can improve your landing speed to ensure a smoother descent. To achieve this, increase thrust as needed to slow down when descending towards the landing pad. I have confidence in your ability to refine your skills and succeed in your future flights. Keep up the good work!
