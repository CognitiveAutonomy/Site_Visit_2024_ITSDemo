The drone's landing was poorly executed, as it ended well outside the designated landing area. You need to adjust thrust to slow down when approaching the landing pad while adjusting the tilt as needed to align the drone with the landing pad. Reflect on how your final control inputs affected the landing, and consider what adjustments you can make next time to stay within the target area. This attempt was not successful, indicating a serious lapse in control at the crucial moment. You received assistance, but focusing on manual landing practice will be essential for improvement.
