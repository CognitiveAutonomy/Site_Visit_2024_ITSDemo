Great job on avoiding a crash during your landing attempt! To improve your landing speed, consider tilting the drone slightly as you approach the landing zone while also reducing thrust to ensure a gentle descent. With your skills, I'm confident you'll enhance your performance and master the landing process soon! Keep up the good work!
