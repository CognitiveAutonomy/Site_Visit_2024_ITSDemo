The drone's landing trajectory was inconsistent, demonstrating challenges in maintaining a stable approach to the landing pad. To enhance smoothness, focus on adjusting the tilt incrementally during descent to keep the drone aligned while applying thrust to manage speed. Reflect on how your control of tilt and thrust impacted the drone's path and what adjustments could lead to a steadier landing next time. This attempt was lacking precision, and without addressing these basic control elements, successful landings will continue to be a struggle.
