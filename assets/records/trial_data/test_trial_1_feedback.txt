The drone's path showed significant abrupt movements, indicating a need for smoother control while approaching the landing area. Focus on adjusting the tilt gently to align the drone over the landing pad and use thrust to minimize any unintended shifts. Reflect on how making small, controlled adjustments can improve your overall approach next time. This attempt was not well-executed, demonstrating a lack of control in maneuvering towards the landing pad.
