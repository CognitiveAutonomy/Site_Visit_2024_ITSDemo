The trajectory indicated a lack of smoothness in your approach, causing an unstable landing. To improve, focus on adjusting the tilt in small increments to keep the drone stable while descending towards the landing pad. Reflect on how your control or lack of it during descent affected the alignment with the landing area. This attempt missed the target; your control inputs need serious refinement to achieve a better outcome.
