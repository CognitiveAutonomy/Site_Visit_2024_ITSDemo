You did a great job avoiding a crash during your flight. However, the area where you can most improve is your landing speed. To enhance your control during landing, adjust thrust to slow down as you approach the landing pad while aligning with it. I am confident that with practice, you'll master this skill effectively. Overall, your efforts are commendable and you're on the right track!
