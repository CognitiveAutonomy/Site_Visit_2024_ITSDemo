The drone's trajectory shows inconsistent smoothness during the approach to the landing pad. To improve this, try adjusting the tilt in small increments to maintain a steady descent while aligning the drone's flight path to the landing area. Reflect on how your adjustments can lead to a more controlled landing next time. This landing was off-target and clearly illustrates the need for better control; without improvement, you risk further inaccuracies in future attempts.
