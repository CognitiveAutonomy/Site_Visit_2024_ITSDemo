The drone's trajectory indicates a significant issue with the landing component, as it failed to reach the landing pad. You need to increase thrust while descending to ensure a controlled approach to the target area. Reflect on how better control over thrust could improve your accuracy in landing. This attempt was ineffective, and it's clear that your approach needs serious refinement for future flights.
