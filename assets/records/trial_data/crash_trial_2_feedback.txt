To enhance your landing accuracy, focus on increasing thrust gradually as you approach the landing pad, while also tilting the drone towards the center of the pad to stabilize your descent. I'm confident that with practice, you'll master the landing process beautifully. Your effort in flying the drone is commendable, and I have no doubt you'll see great improvements with these adjustments!
