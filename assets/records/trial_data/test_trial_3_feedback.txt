The drone clearly crashed on the right side, indicating a need for improvement in your landing strategy. You should focus on reducing thrust as you approach the landing pad to better control your descent. Reflect on how your control inputs failed to align the drone properly over the target area and consider what adjustments can be made next time. The landing was a failure due to a lack of proper management over your descent, which must be corrected in future attempts.
