You did a great job navigating the drone towards the landing pad, showing good overall control in maintaining altitude. However, you can improve on the smoothness of your landing approach to ensure a more stable descent. To achieve this, try adjusting the tilt in small increments when aligning the drone with the landing pad. I believe with practice and these adjustments, you'll master the landing process confidently. Overall, your performance shows promise for continuous improvement as you practice.
