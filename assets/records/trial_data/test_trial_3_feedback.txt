The drone's approach to the landing pad was too rough, indicating a lack of smoothness in your control. To improve this, you should try adjusting the tilt in small increments to maintain a stable descent while using thrust to reduce speed as you approach the landing area. Reflect on how smoother movements can lead to better alignment with the landing pad next time. Your performance showed significant room for improvement, especially in managing the drone's movements effectively.
