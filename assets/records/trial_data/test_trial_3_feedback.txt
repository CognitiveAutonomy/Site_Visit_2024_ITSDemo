Great job on successfully avoiding a crash during your flight! To improve your landing speed, try increasing your thrust as you approach the landing pad to ensure a smoother descent. I'm confident that with a bit more practice, you'll master this task and achieve safe landings consistently. Keep up the fantastic work!
