The drone's approach to the landing pad was not smooth, which affected overall stability. To improve this, try adjusting the tilt in small increments to help maintain stability when aligning the drone to the landing pad. Reflect on how your adjustments influenced the drone's final trajectory and what you can do better next time. This attempt was inadequate; proper control inputs are essential for a successful landing. You received assistance; more practice in landing manually will help you improve your skills.
