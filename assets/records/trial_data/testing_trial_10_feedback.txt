Your most significant area for improvement is the final landing maneuver, as the drone crashed on the left side. To enhance this, adjust the tilt to align the drone's flight path more accurately with the landing pad and increase thrust as needed to slow down during descent. I believe you have the skills to achieve a safe landing with practice and focus on these adjustments. Overall, the feedback is intended to help refine your technique in landing the drone effectively.
