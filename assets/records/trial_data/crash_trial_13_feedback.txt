You did well to avoid a crash while attempting the landing task. However, you can improve your landing speed to ensure a smoother and safer descent to the landing pad. To achieve this, increase thrust as needed to slow down when descending towards the landing pad. I have confidence in your abilities to refine your technique and master this task effectively. Keep practicing!
