The drone's trajectory lacked the smoothness needed for better control during the descent. To improve this, focus on adjusting the tilt gently to maintain alignment with the landing pad while using thrust to stabilize your approach. Reflect on how small, precise movements can enhance your landing accuracy in future attempts. This attempt showed a clear inconsistency in handling, indicating a need for more attention to the nuances of your control inputs.
