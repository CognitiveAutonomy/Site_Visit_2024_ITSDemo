Great job on avoiding a crash and demonstrating control over the drone during the flight! To enhance your landing speed, try increasing thrust as you approach the landing pad, ensuring a gentler touch down. I believe in your ability to master this skill and consistently achieve safe landings. Keep up the good work, and stay confident in your progress!
