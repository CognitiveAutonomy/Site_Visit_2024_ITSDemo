You've done a great job in navigating the drone and avoiding a crash during your flight. However, the landing speed can be improved to ensure a smoother touchdown on the landing pad. To enhance your landing speed, increase thrust as needed to slow down when descending towards the landing pad. I am confident that with practice, you can achieve excellent results in this task. Overall, maintain focus on the landing strategy for future flights.
